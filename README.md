# Comprehensive Problem Solving and Pursuing Deep Dive to Rust Concepts

This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems,
as well as in-depth conceptual explanations of Rust and PS in the broad sense.

## Overview

### Folder structure
- `examples/`: contains various algorithm problems solved in Rust,
  organized by problem category (e.g. backtracking, dynamic programming, etc.).
- `forge/`: contains explanations of Rust's sharp swords and tough armor.


## Examples

Each problem example is organized in its own subfolder and solution approach.
The Rust code for each solution is located in the `examples` subfolder of the example.

## Forge

The `forge` folder contains markdown files that explain concepts in Rust
that weren't obvious to me or that I am fascinated by. 

## Getting Started

To run the examples, simply navigate to the `example` folder and use the   
`cargo run --example "{judge}_{number}"`
command.  

For example:
```bash
cd examples
cargo run cargo run --example boj_2156
```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome.

Feel free to submit a pull request when you find a bug or incorrect description, or when you have any questions.

Note: This is not meant to be a complete learning resource for PS and Rust.
I hope you think of it as a place to organize the concept of PS in a broad sense.
