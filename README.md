# PS - Problem Solving and Rust Concepts Explained

This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems for online judges using the Rust programming language,
as well as conceptual explanations of Rust for PS in the broad sense.

## Overview

### Folder structure
- `examples/`: contains various algorithm problems solved in Rust,
  organized by problem category (e.g. backtracking, dynamic programming, etc.).
- `notes/`: contains explanations of Rust for PS in the broad sense.


## Examples

Each problem example is organized in its own subfolder and solution approach.
The Rust code for each solution is located in the `src` subfolder of the example.

## Notes

The `note` folder contains markdown files that explain concepts in Rust that weren't obvious to me.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, simply navigate to the `example` folder and use the `cargo run --example [your choice]` command. For example:

```bash
cd examples
cargo run cargo run --example boj_2156
```
