# Adaptive Problem Solving: Unraveling Algorithmic Problems and Core Concepts in Computer Science and Rust

This repository serves as a platform for exploring and solving algorithmic problems, and unraveling key concepts in both Computer Science and Rust. While solutions and explanations are often articulated in Rust, our focus spans broader, covering various Computer Science topics such as data processing and distributed systems. The goal is to equip ourselves with technical skills for comprehensive problem-solving in a broad sense and to deepen our understanding of Computer Science.

## Folder structure

- `boj/`: contains various algorithm problems solved in Rust,
  organized by problem category (e.g. backtracking, dynamic programming, etc.).
- `forge-bitCraft/`: contains explanations and dives into the sharp swords and tough armors of programming primitives and various fine trinkets of Computer Science.

## BOJ

Each problem is organized in its own subfolder and solution approach.
The code for each solution is located in the `boj`(Baekjoon Online Judge)
subfolder corresponding to its category.

## Bit crafting Forge

The `forge-bitCraft` folder contains markdown files that explaining various programming primitives and Rust concepts. It also includes details about enchanting technology and Computer Science that piqued my interest or were not initially obvious.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, simply navigate to the `{judge name}` folder and use the   
`cargo run --example "{judge}_{number}"` command.  

For example:

```bash
cd boj
cargo run --example boj_2156
```
