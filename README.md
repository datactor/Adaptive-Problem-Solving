# Comprehensive Problem Solving and Dive to Rust Concepts

This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems,
as well as conceptual explanations of Rust.
The PS stands for the acquisition of technological skills for problem-solving in the broad sense.

## Folder structure
- `examples/`: contains various algorithm problems solved in Rust,
  organized by problem category (e.g. backtracking, dynamic programming, etc.).
- `forge/`: contains explanations of Rust's sharp swords, tough armor and other fine trinkets.

## Examples

Each problem example is organized in its own subfolder and solution approach.
The Rust code for each solution is located in the `examples` subfolder of the example.

## Forge

The `forge` folder contains markdown files that explain concepts in Rust
that weren't obvious to me or that I am fascinated by, as well as other enchanting technologies.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, simply navigate to the `example` folder and use the   
`cargo run --example "{judge}_{number}"`
command.  

For example:
```bash
cd examples
cargo run cargo run --example boj_2156
```
